# Iteration 1
1. This iteration we completed the user stories to view other people's brackets, view info about teams and brackets, make picks, and sign in.
2. During the next iteration we will work on the UI for users to interact with our program (visualize brackets) and allowing administrator to have more control by inputting results
3. The sign-in module does not work right now. Everything else we implemented works, but since we have not implemented a UI yet it is hard to show that the pieces work. 
4. Currently there isn't anything to run, but you can run the tests from each file using javac and java if you would like.

# Iteration 2
1. This iteration we completed user stories to log in through a User Interface, create new brackets and output the brackets to files in a separate folder, and view your bracket and other brackets.
2. During the next iteration we will work on making modifying brackets and scoring brackets so that brackets can be compared to each other, and allow the administrator to have more control.
3. The modifying a bracket/picking all the winners does not work completely, there are a few bugs in it. But for the most part it works.
4. To run the program simply enter the MarchMadness folder and run the run.sh script
